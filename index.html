		-If this perk uses a dice value (rather than a static number), the factor is rolled a new time for each of the opposing mercs which would get affected.<br>
		-The explosion damage isn't affected by other damage modifiers the merc may have, i.e. affected mercs cannot get Drain(22), AlterDamage(1), ExcessDamage(13), Butcher(14), etc. Damage done by explosion is flat damage which cannot be influenced by other perks the merc has.<br>
		-If the mercs on the recieving end of the explosion have perks that modify incoming damage, such as AlterDefence(2) or NegateDamage(18) etc.., Those still run as if recieving damage normally through a combat sequence.<br>
		-In games with more than two players, everyone must decide whether explosion damage is dealt to the mercs controlled by the player whose merc triggered the death (just one group of mercs), or if explosion damage is dealt to every single opposing merc on the field.<br>
		-In the unlikely circumstance an opponent has zero mercs on the field when this perk is triggered, that player will take one hit of damage.

    <td>ExcessDamage</td>
	<td>[Chance] To deal excess damage to next [Faction] enemy after killing an enemy</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;font-size:14;padding:10px;">-If the merc deals 10 damage and it only takes 4 to kill an enemy, you can divert that remaining 6 damage to another enemy of your choice. If it only took 5 damage to kill that one, you can divert that remaining 1 damage to a third enemy, etc...<br>
		-A typical combat sequence does not arise from this chain, so like none of the subsequent enemies affected attack the merc as well. the only damage the merc takes is from the primary interaction.<br>
		-This perk needs to be rolled every time it passes through an enemy. you can't roll it once at the beginning and then dump all remaining damage onto every other enemy until it's done.
		-During the combat sequence, both mercs still damage each other at the same time. The "chain" still follows through to the other potential mercs, but this card's potentially diminished combat score doesn't influence the damage from the "chain". (Example: This card has 20 combat score. the card it attacks has 10 combat score, but deals a flat +10 damage. SO they deal damage at the same time, resulting in both dying. even though this card has a combat score of 0, the remaining 10 damage can still be passed on to more enemies.<br>
		-If the "chain" of damage passes into a merc with NegateDamage(18), and it successfully rolls, that merc blocks all damage and essentially stops the chain, as if it had infinite combat score. Thus the chain cannot continue through them to more enemies afterwards.
		-Excess damage could be diverted to the player directly. The opponent could still intercept that attack with one of their mercs, if possible.

	-The timer starts on the turn that follows the one which the combat sequence occurred in.<br>
	-Passive abilities, like Bulwark(4), NegateDamage(18), LandOccupy(19), SpellImmunity(21), AlterDefence(2), etc, are not affected by being inflicted by freeze.<br>
	-This ability synergizes with perks that alter how damage is dealt, such as ExcessDamage(13), where all concurrently damaged mercs will be affected as well.<br>
	-Respawning removes the Freeze effect.<br>
	-If a merc is attacked and already has freeze, the durations are not added onto each other either, and instead the previous duration (however much time is left), is overwritten by the most recent duration added (only if the most recent duration is longer than the previous)

	-If one merc takes damage, the other DOES NOT lose health. the only factor lifelink alters is whether they're alive or dead. this also means they DON'T share abilities like some megaunit. If one gets healed, the other does not recieve that same value. It's only their absolute life/death state.<br>
	-If the merc with this ability is deployed and it successfully activates, but none of the enemy mercs are of the required faction, the ability is wasted.<br>
	-While the most conventional use is to link to an enemy's merc, if the requirements are met you could also link it with one of your own (.?)
